# 🏦 Vulnerable Banking Mini App (Security Demo)

## 📌 Description

This project is a **banking simulation web application** developed to demonstrate common web security vulnerabilities, specifically:

- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

The application intentionally includes vulnerable components and then provides a **secure mode** to show how these attacks can be mitigated.

⚠️ This project is for **educational purposes only**.
